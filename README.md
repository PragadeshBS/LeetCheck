# LeetCheck Browser Extension

LeetCheck is a browser extension designed to enhance your LeetCode experience by allowing you to monitor and follow the progress of fellow LeetCode users. With LeetCheck, you can keep track of the number of questions solved by users in different difficulty categories â€“ easy, medium, and hard.

This extension relies on the API provided by [JeremyTsaii/leetcode-stats-api](https://github.com/JeremyTsaii/leetcode-stats-api), which enables LeetCheck to fetch and display accurate and up-to-date user statistics.

## Features

- **User Monitoring:** Follow your favorite LeetCode users to stay updated on their coding journey.
- **Category Insights:** Get an overview of solved questions in different difficulty levels.
- **Personal Progress:** Track your own achievements and compare them with others.
- **Seamless Integration:** LeetCheck seamlessly integrates into your browser, enhancing your LeetCode workflow.
